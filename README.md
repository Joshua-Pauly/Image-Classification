# Image-Classification
This project was collaboration between me and my teammate Josue Perez. 

This project aimed at building a Deep Learning based model that was capable of accurately and precisely identifying the type of natural scenery present in each image of the dataset. This model distinguishes images into the six different categories; Forest, Buildings, Street, Sea, Mountain and glacier.

We created multiple models to test the effectiveness of transfer learning vs Vanilla CNN. The CNN resulted in an accuracy score of 78% whereas the highest transfer learning model resulted in an accuracy rate of 92%.
